# Supporting or rejecting ?? To declare our cryptos monnaie

==Supporting== !
First, we will talk about the cryptocurrency's déclaration, Then I will ==disclose== you  my position about it.

To earn money inside french state isn't free ! In fact, the state have the right to examine you personal financial account. Each revenus is taxed. When a french citizen invested his money in the market, we speack of ==tax law.==
In this example, the french citizen have to declare each ==foreign== account and ==the whole of== capital gain of transaction on year.
For exemple : Bob bought  1 BTC 1000 euros and 1 years later bob send 1 BTC 2000 EUROS.
The tax is based on the capital gain, ==so that's== 1000 euros. Flat Tax, the name of tax is to 30%, so that's 300 euros.
It ==annoys== me to give 300 euros for state ! arhh

So, why not to say anything ?
Because...
